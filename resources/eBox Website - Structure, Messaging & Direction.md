# eBox Website – Structure, Messaging & Direction

# Purpose of the Website

The primary goal of the eBox website is to **generate qualified demos** from MRI users.

### Secondary goals:

* Educate prospects before sales calls  
* Clearly position eBox as the go-to solution for MRI data friction  
* Reduce time spent explaining the product during demos  
* Support outbound and referral-driven sales

## Positioning Summary

### What eBox is

**Software built specifically for MRI users.**

eBox exists to solve the real, day-to-day operational problems that MRI users experience but MRI does not solve well.

### Core positioning

* Built for real estate teams using MRI  
* Focused on solving real operational friction  
* Designed for finance and operations teams, not developers  
* Proven in production with real clients

### Tone

* Direct and confident  
* Practical and outcome-focused  
* Honest about MRI limitations  
* Professional, not corporate  
* Opinionated where it helps clarity

## Primary Product Focus

### eForms (primary product for launch)

This will be the hero of the website.

**Core value:**  
 A fast, safe, and structured way to get data into MRI without any of the manual work, or risk.

**Why it matters:**

* MRI makes importing data painful, risky and sometimes, not possible  
* Finance and ops teams waste hours on manual processes  
* Errors are easy to make and hard to catch  
* Existing tools are admin-heavy and unintuitive

eForms solves this.

### eConnect

* Secondary product  
* Referenced but not the focus  
* Positioned as “also part of eBox”  
* Full product page can come later

## Target Audience

### Primary buyer

**CFO / Head of Finance** 

* Owns data accuracy  
* Feels the pain of journals, imports, and approvals  
* Responsible for risk and efficiency  
* Wants things to “just work”

### **Other buyers**

* Head of Asset Management  
* Property Directors  
* Property / Portfolio Managers  
* Finance and operations teams

### **Not the audience**

* Developers  
* IT teams as primary buyers  
* Small residential operators
