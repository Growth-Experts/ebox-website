### Summary

The onboarding and strategy meeting, attended by Jason Bagley, Lauren Peacock, Taylor Lawrence, Bjorn, and Dean Nixon, established EBox as a distinct, startup-like entity within Open Box focused on solving real estate software gaps, particularly in the MRI ERP system, with their E-forms and E-Connect products. Jason Bagley outlined the engagement approach to identify EBox's current status and goals, which include growing their Annual Recurring Revenue from 42 unique clients and transitioning branding from "openbox software" to "eBox" to aggressively market and conduct outreach to their list of MRI PMXD clients. Bjorn and Dean Nixon agreed to prioritize an urgent website build by Jason Bagley's team using Ripplet, a sales process workshop, and a marketing outreach strategy, leveraging the current client base and addressing common sales friction like requests for SOC compliance.

### Details

* **Meeting Attendees and Purpose** Jason Bagley initiated the meeting, which included Lauren Peacock, Taylor Lawrence, Bjorn, and Dean Nixon, after confirming Taylor's acceptance to the call. The purpose of the meeting was to conduct onboarding, where Jason would lead the process, and the rest of the team would take notes and jump in with questions ([00:00:00](#00:00:00)) ([00:07:40](#00:07:40)). Bjorn was identified as the Director of Products at EBox, and Dean Nixon was the CTO ([00:08:36](#00:08:36)).

* **EBox Business Structure and Team Introductions** Bjorn and Dean Nixon clarified that EBox operates as a distinct entity, despite being within the Open Box group, functioning like a startup ([00:08:36](#00:08:36)). Jason Bagley introduced themself as the main point of contact from Growth Experts, working alongside Taylor Lawrence, who specializes in copywriting, data, and analytics ([00:07:40](#00:07:40)). Lauren Peacock supports everything else in the background ([00:08:36](#00:08:36)). Dean Nixon is responsible for the technical side, including the pipeline and roadmap, while also having a stake in sales and marketing. The team agreed to use "EBox" as the reference for the company to solidify its identity as a company rather than a division ([00:09:44](#00:09:44)).

* **Engagement Strategy with EBox** Jason Bagley outlined the engagement approach, which involves uncovering EBox's current situation (Point A) and defining their vision and goals (Point B). The Growth Experts team will focus on strategy and execution, including running tests, measuring results, ensuring correct tracking, learning from data, and repeating successful processes to help EBox reach its goals ([00:10:51](#00:10:51)).

* **Origin and Market Gap for EBox Products** Dean Nixon explained that EBox exists to fulfill gaps in the MRI software ERP system, which they primarily support, stemming from client demand. Initially developing e-connect for one client, they expanded to their current client base ([00:12:44](#00:12:44)). Bjorn added that the broader purpose is to create software that solves gaps in real estate solutions generally, though currently focused on MRI ([00:14:06](#00:14:06)).

* **E-Forms Product and Problem Solved** E-forms was created to address the lack of a user-friendly way to import data into MRI's ERP system. Dean Nixon noted that MRI's existing solutions for data import are often uncomfortable for clients and lack a proper solution, despite having shown a potential solution years ago that has not progressed ([00:14:06](#00:14:06)). E-forms is positioned as a user-friendly, business-centric import solution ([00:15:35](#00:15:35)).

* **Competitive Landscape and Acquisition Strategy** Dean Nixon and Bjorn discussed MRI's focus on acquiring companies rather than investing in existing products, leading to technical debt ([00:16:50](#00:16:50)). MRI has an in-house competitor tool for data import, but it still lacks necessary user considerations ([00:24:23](#00:24:23)). Bjorn confirmed EBox is focused on creating a product business with longevity and is not actively seeking acquisition of the entire entity ([00:19:00](#00:19:00)).

* **E-Forms Core Functionality and Differentiation** Dean Nixon described e-forms as allowing the crafting of imports to reflect specific business scenarios, such as accounting journals or lease data, enabling bulk data processing ([00:20:11](#00:20:11)). Bjorn likened e-forms to a "Google forms for real estate software," highly customizable with the addition of workflows for approvals and notifications. MRI's existing method for data import is an admin-centric, CSV-based tool that requires users to understand underlying database tables and poses high risks, such as the ability to delete data ([00:22:17](#00:22:17)).

* **E-Connect Product and Value Proposition** E-Connect was developed to solve user frustrations with emailing correspondence to tenants through MRI, which offered limited branding, attachment control, and tracking ([00:30:10](#00:30:10)). E-Connect uses the client's own email domains, tracks delivery, allows securing (encrypting) documents, and branding the entire email chain to reflect the client's brand ([00:31:27](#00:31:27)). Bjorn demonstrated the stark difference in customer experience between MRI's generic emails and the custom, professional emails facilitated by E-Connect, calling the transition a "huge kind of we've gotten here once with a client" that secured a sale quickly ([00:33:37](#00:33:37)).

* **MRI Relationship and Pricing Models** Dean Nixon described the relationship with MRI as "very good," especially regarding E-Connect, though E-forms is newer to market ([00:25:25](#00:25:25)). Bjorn added that EBox are official partners with MRI, but E-Connect is listed on their partner page, not E-forms ([00:26:59](#00:26:59)). MRI's issues, such as poor email design, are likely due to focusing on legislative changes and technical debt rather than revenue generation from fixing these problems ([00:37:00](#00:37:00)). E-Connect is priced based on lease volumes, while E-forms is based on user volume, with both generally billed annually in advance ([00:38:58](#00:38:58)).

* **Ideal Customer Profile and Target Market** The ideal customer for EBox, particularly for E-forms, should be using MRI software, preferably with a minimum of 300 to 400 plus leases ([00:40:01](#00:40:01)). The sweet spot includes commercial real estate, mixed-use, or retail sectors, as residential properties often have smaller budgets despite high unit numbers. The initial focus for E-forms is on North America and the MRI PMX product ([00:41:11](#00:41:11)). The main problem areas addressed by E-forms are accounting journals, leasing, and vendor/accounts payable use cases. Target roles for decision-makers include Head of Finance, CFO, or Head of Asset Management/Property Manager ([00:43:20](#00:43:20)) ([00:45:38](#00:45:38)).

* **EBox Current Status and Goals** EBox currently has a team of 11 people and 42 unique clients across their two core products ([00:47:43](#00:47:43)). Their billing is annual, with only consulting work being charged monthly, which currently accounts for about 10% of revenue ([00:48:55](#00:48:55)). EBox is focused on growing its Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and is willing to sacrifice consulting work to secure licenses. They have about 30 open leads, with two hot leads for e-forms ([00:49:56](#00:49:56)). Bjorn is confident that getting an initial sales pitch to 80 clients in North America would be a significant step toward their revenue goals for the next 12 months ([00:54:50](#00:54:50)).

* **Technology Stack and Sales Process** EBox primarily uses Pipe Drive for sales tracking, Office 365, Loom for recording demos, and Zendesk for support, but they are flexible with Loom and Zendesk ([00:55:46](#00:55:46)) ([00:57:28](#00:57:28)). Bjorn noted that the sales data in Pipe Drive is improving ([00:56:32](#00:56:32)). The sales process is managed formally by Bjorn and Dean Nixon, with some support from individuals across the Open Box group for introductions and initial assessments ([00:58:27](#00:58:27)).

* **Sales Objections and Friction Points** Taylor Lawrence asked about common objections during the sales process. Bjorn stated that there are no frequent "nos" but some friction points include requests for SOC compliance, which EBox addresses with ISO 27001 certification, and regional hosting in America, which they are prepared to address if a large client requires it. Smaller clients, particularly in APAC and South Africa, sometimes find the price too high ([00:59:18](#00:59:18)).

* **Past Growth Efforts and Learning** Jason Bagley initiated the discussion by asking about past growth attempts, successes, and failures, as well as current activities ([01:01:40](#01:01:40)). Bjorn mentioned that attending conferences under the "open box" consultancy banner, particularly in America, was a failure because they lacked the attention, traction, and access typically afforded to a product company ([01:02:25](#01:02:25)). Dean Nixon added that the messaging was lost in the noise, leading people not to realize they had a solution for a specific gap ([01:03:24](#01:03:24)).

* **Topup's US Marketing and Product Focus** Dean Nixon discussed unsuccessful marketing efforts for "econ" into the US with Topup, the entity Open Box acquired software from, where Dean Nixon used to be the CTO ([01:03:24](#01:03:24)) ([01:05:31](#01:05:31)). Dean Nixon clarified that the North American market is not mature enough for econ because payments are still very check-based and use clearing houses, leading them to focus on e-forms for the US market due to clear demand. They confirmed that econ is successful in EMIA and APAC regions ([01:04:30](#01:04:30)).

* **Current Sales and Team Strategy** Bjorn explained that they are aiming for lean team growth, targeting to only increase the team by 20% even if revenue doubles, focusing on good processes and good people for exponential growth ([01:05:31](#01:05:31)). Bjorn highlighted that a successful current practice for econ sales is utilizing simple visualizations and friction-focused selling instead of a full sales demo of the product, which is often too detailed for decision-makers, resulting in most signatures without the client ever seeing the actual product ([01:06:20](#01:06:20)).

* **Proposed Workshops and Urgent Priorities** Jason Bagley determined that an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) workshop is unnecessary because the client base (MRI users) is already clearly defined. Jason Bagley suggested a sales process workshop to review their sales journey from lead to closing, noting that Bjorn agreed the e-forms process needs work ([01:08:26](#01:08:26)). Bjorn outlined the immediate priorities, which include initiating outreach this quarter, needing a website, and urgently transitioning the branding to "eBox" from "openbox software" because they cannot aggressively market under the latter name ([01:10:18](#01:10:18)).

* **eBox Rebrand and Marketing Plan** The rebrand to eBox is critical, involving updating support emails, notifying existing clients, and changing branding on the MRI partner website ([01:11:11](#01:11:11)). Dean Nixon suggested combining the rebrand announcement with a new software release newsletter. Jason Bagley confirmed that the client has a logo and a URL for eBox ([01:11:59](#01:11:59)).

* **Website and Branding Guideline Discussion** Jason Bagley recommended creating a basic brand guideline for fonts and color schemes to assist in creating collateral ([01:12:57](#01:12:57)). Bjorn expressed a willingness to work on brand guidelines but emphasized they do not want to limit the marketing team's creativity, referencing a previous website design that was rejected ([01:14:06](#01:14:06)). Jason Bagley decided against focusing on immediate branding guidelines, preferring to push creative boundaries and scale back if needed, rather than starting conservatively ([01:15:49](#01:15:49)).

* **Website Development and Outreach Strategy** Jason Bagley proposed that their team handle the eBox site build using Ripplet to shorten the timeline and increase impact, which Dean Nixon and Bjorn agreed with ([01:17:25](#01:17:25)). The next steps include developing a site map and plan, followed by content creation, and a product demo from the clients to inform the build ([01:18:32](#01:18:32)). Regarding the targeted outreach, Dean Nixon confirmed they have a "gold" list of attendees from a past user conference, most of whom are PMXD clients, which Jason Bagley plans to use for an outreach campaign strategy ([01:19:19](#01:19:19)).

* **Client Communication and Conferences** Dean Nixon reiterated that the main focus should be the website and the outreach to the MRI list, alongside leveraging the existing client base for cross-selling e-forms to current e-connect users ([01:21:02](#01:21:02)). Dean Nixon also mentioned two upcoming MRI-based conferences, one in Australia (August) and a large one in America (October). Regarding existing clients, Dean Nixon noted communication is infrequent, primarily limited to update notifications, though Bjorn specified they maintain closer contact with their top five clients who constitute half of their revenue ([01:21:51](#01:21:51)).

* **Customer Testimonials and Next Steps** Jason Bagley suggested interviewing end-users to gather their specific language, frustrations, and favored aspects of the product for better marketing material, although this is not an urgent task ([01:22:40](#01:22:40)). Bjorn confirmed they had a session scheduled after the meeting to ask a visiting client testimonial questions ([01:24:10](#01:24:10)). Jason Bagley concluded the meeting by stating they would summarize all agreed next steps, access details, and meeting cadence in a succinct follow-up email ([01:25:01](#01:25:01)).

### Suggested next steps

- [ ] Jason Bagley will ask Bjorn and Dean Nixon for the pricing details for eformms and e-connect.

- [ ] Bjorn will provide the ARR number and the six-month growth percentage goal.

- [ ] Jason Bagley will set up a time next week to receive a demo of everything to inform the process of building the site.

- [ ] Bjorn will provide Jason Bagley with more concrete goals related to their forecasting.

- [ ] Jason Bagley will create a plan for the outreach campaign, explaining the chosen direction, methods, and best practices for the targeted campaign, and then present it to the group.

- [ ] Jason Bagley will send an email recap of everything, including next steps, meeting cadence, and how to get access to the team.

- [ ] The group will hold a sales process workshop to review how eforms does sales and identify any gaps in the current process.

### 00:07:40 {#00:07:40}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Um you guys just pretty much need to sit back. Uh I'll ask all the questions, you can give me all the answers. Uh and we'll take a lot of notes. Um and yeah, that sort of kicks kicks things off um for for working together. So yeah, I think you guys know me in front of growth experts. I will be your main um I guess point of contact. I'll be working on this with uh with the two of you. Um then I'm going hand over to Taylor who's also going to be working with me on this work and you guys on this. Taylor, hello.  
**Taylor Lawrence:** guys. Um, hi. I'm Taylor. Love being you all. Um, yeah, I'm going to be helping Kay out with your accounts. I'm pretty looking forward to working with you guys and seeing what your company is all about. I do quite a bit of copyrightiting and data and analytics. I like analyzing data and making data driven decisions.  
   
 

### 00:08:36 {#00:08:36}

   
**Taylor Lawrence:** But yeah, I'm overall pretty excited and that's about it from me.  
**Lauren Peacock:** and then I'll I'll jump in. I'm Lauren, so we've briefly met over email and I basically take care of everything else in the background that Jason and Taylor don't need to worry about. So that's and that's us.  
**Jason Bagley:** It's a bit of an understatement, but we'll take that. Yeah. Be  
**Bjorn:** Hire Bjorn um director of products of MOS.  
**Jason Bagley:** on  
**Bjorn:** Um we kind of Dean and I head up the the products what is sometimes referred to as the products division but actually its own kind of entity. Um and very much kind of operate despite being in the open box group operate as a startup. Um and so other than kind of being director of products overseeing the products team um also kinding head up sales and kind of account management that Dean and I also do some sharing between the two of us. was created. It's  
**Dean Nixon:** Uh yeah, Bill covered it all. Dean Nixon, CTO. So I run the more technical side of the the division.  
   
 

### 00:09:44 {#00:09:44}

   
**Dean Nixon:** Um kind of focus around the uh the pipeline, the road map,  
**Jason Bagley:** Awesome.  
**Dean Nixon:** uh but also have a fair stake in in kind of the sales and marketing activities as well.  
**Bjorn:** Dean's also of godfather and original designer of the products. Uh so I'm also going to stop saying division and start saying saying entity because we actually increasingly with your help we're hoping to kind of strip out the two from each other.  
**Jason Bagley:** Well, I mean, we're we're just going to reference everything we do as um um as EBox then, right? Because that's the name of the the company that we're working with here.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah, great.  
**Jason Bagley:** So like let's we will try and remove open box from our vocab um for for um for this so that we get used to this being not a division but a company. So yeah definitely obviously going to be helping with that. Okay. Um cool. Uh sorry I'm just trying to rearrange my screens here so I can actually see what's going on and okay cool. So kicking things off here.  
   
 

### 00:10:51 {#00:10:51}

   
**Jason Bagley:** You don't need that on the side here. So the way we like to obviously work with our clients and obviously the way we're going to work with you guys and this is how we see the world is that you're at a point in this business right now right on the left here there's a whole bunch of you know facts and data about where you're at um that we want to I guess uncover but there's a point B and that's why you sort of want to work with us um is you want to get somewhere right there's some vision there's some goals that you want to hit there's projects that you need to launch there's all of that and that's where you want to be And in the between is at the bottom here is like this is how we're going to help you get there. So obviously there's a bit of strategy here and there we're going to definitely want to talk about but there's the tactics the execution of those um strategies. So we're not here just coming up high level and coming up with ideas and saying good luck off you go.  
   
 

### 00:11:41

   
**Jason Bagley:** We obviously do the execution of that. So that's where the taxing execution comes by. As Laur as Taylor mentioned we want to measure all of this. So, we very much like to make sure if we're going to run a, you know, a test on something, we're going to run some outline emails. We want to measure that. We want to make sure tracking is set up correctly on your website at the beginning, not halfway through some some sort of test that we may be running. Learning from those what works, what doesn't work. Cut that the stuff that necessarily doesn't work because we've put saying we want to hit X number of views, X number of leads, whatever that is. Is it not working? cut that or double down on it. If it's working, repeat the process. And that's sort of in a nutshell how we want to work together and get uh get you guys to hit those goals and obviously this vision for this for this business. Um so starting off here, um okay, the only thing I've put on this board are two e forms you connect because I know that's the two products, but I think if you guys could start uh I've got some questions here.  
   
 

### 00:12:44 {#00:12:44}

   
**Jason Bagley:** If you guys could just start either one of you like why does this why does eBox exist? Why does this business exist?  
**Bjorn:** Uh, good products realology  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah, I mean ultimately it fulfills a gap um in there's MRI software is a ERP that we primarily support and the there's a there's a number of gaps in MRI that uh currently exists that they're not uh fulfilling. So it was out of client demand that we we requested to develop kind of e econ then later on eformms themselves. So once we once we developed e-connect uh we did it for one client originally to begin with that quickly transitioned through to the client base that we have now.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. And and what are with regards to those I guess these products um sort of what's the specific problems that those and if you want to start with the one that's more important or the one that we'll get going with you know what specific problem does that does that product solve?  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah,  
**Bjorn:** Um just before we ask that just to expand on the MRI software.  
   
 

### 00:14:06 {#00:14:06}

   
**Dean Nixon:** sure.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** So the I guess the why historically was that MRI software specifically had gaps and there were there were more products than just these two but these two are the ones we're going to focus on. Uh but I think more holistically the why we exist now is to kind of create software create products that solve gaps in real estate solutions in general more broadly. And so currently we are quite focused on MRI but we're starting to branch out a little bit. So worth just kind of noting that I think.  
**Dean Nixon:** We're good.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** Um I think if we if we start with maybe with eformms because that's kind of the hot topic for us more than anything else. So um eformms was created purely out of the the gap in MRI that MRI has no user friendly way of importing data into its ERP into into its underlying system. Um,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** and that's kind of the when we've been to various trade shows and conferences around MRI, you know, we've been in a couple of sessions where it's been almost uncomfortable where MRI has been sat there in front of clients and the clients are asking why they can't get this data in this way and they've kind they've kind of got something half put together but no real solution for it.  
   
 

### 00:15:35 {#00:15:35}

   
**Dean Nixon:** Um so yeah so e that's what eformms was was created out of um it's a userfriendly businesscentric uh import solution that was created um yeah for filling that  
**Jason Bagley:** just just on that um and and I know we have briefly spoken about that.  
**Dean Nixon:** gap  
**Jason Bagley:** So yes, they don't have a like a a well-baked or good solution for this. How would they ever build it in the like do you ever think they would in the future?  
**Dean Nixon:** So they put together kind of their solution for it um a good number of years ago now. Um and they kind of at one of their conferences they showed it and it you know it was it looked it looked good on paper. uh we're still going to the same conferences five, six, seven years later and they're still showing the same thing and it's still in the same way basically. So they haven't over the last sort of seven years, seven plus years have come up with the solution for it yet. Uh and there's no real traction kind of pulling them into in in further down that path that that we can see.  
   
 

### 00:16:50 {#00:16:50}

   
**Dean Nixon:** Certainly um they're a very um MI software are a very um quite what would how would you describe it? Basically they like to acquire other companies quite quickly. Um so over the last few years they've acquired a large number of of companies that that that have software that are very similar to their their flagship product which is called PMX. Um, and I I feel that they're more they're more kind of acquisition based than they are kind of investment based on their existing  
**Bjorn:** Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** products.  
**Bjorn:** And just to add on to that, so they I mean I think they've acquired I don't know what the number is, but it's in at least a few hundred companies, possibly into over a thousand over the last few years. I mean that they're kind of aggressively acquiring companies. Um and those Dean and I attended that that session at a recent North America conference where they were launching essentially their competitor to um eformms although it's kind of existed in some form or another and they were saying now it's ready now it's the big thing.  
   
 

### 00:18:01

   
**Bjorn:** Uh and it was like both sessions were kind of deeply uncomfortable exactly what Dean's saying to the point that I'm like I just wish I could kind of walk around and give everyone my card and we try to write down some names and catch people but the frustration was palpable. Everyone left there so frustrated. Um, everyone went to those sessions to the point that uh it's such a big need that the room was overflowing. They didn't have enough seats. People were standing around the outside. These are like, you know, CTO's and decision makers of companies and they're just huge amounts of people, two sessions, both overflowing, both like aggressively upset people um and like difficult to sit through. Um, so even though there has been some development on their side, it's almost feels like it's the more they push into that at least for the time being, the more opportunity they're creating for us because they're kind of creating friction which we solve. That may not be the case forever. Uh they may get it right at some stage, but  
**Jason Bagley:** No indication of that yet.  
   
 

### 00:19:00 {#00:19:00}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Just on the just hearing that they are bit an acquisition first company by the sounds of it. Is that in your mind in the back of your head some down the the goal of of of um EBOX to be acquired by them or is it more just there's a gap here we want to fill that  
**Bjorn:** Yeah, we just we're trying to eBox. We're trying to create a um a good product business that has longevity. Um we've kind of discussed the concept of potentially kind of exiting products uh if they got to a place where we felt we wanted to exit them rather than uh keep building them. Um so there there's a potential for us to exit products. It's we're not actively trying to exit any of our products. Um but we wouldn't ever want to at least for the foreseeable future actually be selling the entity. That would be kind of one of the arrows in our quiver. Um currently we have four products although we're kind of suns setting the other two. Um but over time we'd like to grow these two into more gaps as we find them.  
   
 

### 00:20:11 {#00:20:11}

   
**Bjorn:** Uh yeah and we'd kind of like to keep growing that as a business. So the business itself no we don't want to exit it.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. And on the e-form side, like you obviously said you can get data into into MRI. What are some of what are the things that you're doing really well that this obviously MRI doesn't do? So I understand you can obviously I'm assuming build custom forms and that allows you to capture data and validates the data. Is that the main premise of it or is there any other bits and pieces to it?  
**Dean Nixon:** we're able to craft the imports to be to reflect the particular business scenario. So if they have a need to import let's say accounting journals, we can configure our import to look like the MRI entry screen for their accounting journals but be able to process bulk data. And then likewise for other business scenarios. So if they need to process lease data or uh entity or building information, we're able to craft the imports to accurately reflect that particular business scenario.  
   
 

### 00:21:15

   
**Dean Nixon:** So the end users filling out have full knowledge on that particular area. So they are subject to badger experts on that particular area they're doing. It's their primary job. They just give we're just giving them the tools to be able to add data in a bulk way there.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. No. Yeah. Okay. Got you. And then there's also obviously that's you mentioned bulk data. So that's obviously like just literally importing I'm assuming CSVs or that type of content that those type of files as well as building forms to a business called E forms as well.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yes, correct. So as a each each data import scenario starts with a bespoke form that can then be bulk bulk imported into via Excel. Um uh and yeah and then obviously that that import itself can follow a workflow of business ru r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r rules so approvals and notifications and certain certain key notific certain signoff points and then ultimately it'll end up uh in in MRI.  
   
 

### 00:22:17 {#00:22:17}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, got you.  
**Bjorn:** So, so something we we never say,  
**Jason Bagley:** And  
**Bjorn:** but I guess helpful just in visualizing the product is um it's it's a it's kind of a Google forms for real estate software, highly customizable just in terms of kind of conceptualizing it. Um and so that being but with the addition of kind of being able to add workflows so have  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** multip people multiple people approve different parts of it or fill out different parts of it in addition to the bulk upload.  
**Jason Bagley:** And h how do how do people currently get data into MRI? just their interface and having to manually fill out forms the whole time because it sounds like there isn't like an import function or you got to customize your file to be specific way and it's very  
**Dean Nixon:** So the users have to use a very admin ccentric tool that's designed  
**Jason Bagley:** difficult  
**Dean Nixon:** for kind of on boarding and data migrations. So it's a CSV based tool that they have to put the data in the in the structure of the underlying MRI database tables.  
   
 

### 00:23:20

   
**Dean Nixon:** Um so a number of times they have to yeah you fill out columns they wouldn't necessarily know what they mean. um use IDs instead of the actual values to fill out these forms. Um there's also some very worrying tick boxes on the import process that will allow users to actually delete all the data in the underlying table before they import the data. So there's some very high risk type of uh type of functionality there. There is the ability MRI has to build they have a report builder tool that allows you to um import data as well. Um and it's quite a long process to do that. So for them to be able to let's say do an accounting journal import. It's a it's a few days consultancy plus a couple of days development to build a particular form that's then static and set set in time basically. So if anything ever changes behind the scenes or if if MRI upgrades, it doesn't upgrade with them. It doesn't work very well uh longer  
**Jason Bagley:** Wow.  
   
 

### 00:24:23 {#00:24:23}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. And this sort of competitor that you spoke about that uh they acquired and and that  
**Dean Nixon:** term.  
**Jason Bagley:** uncomfortableness in the room is that's the the features round that you're speaking about or or do they have sort of different features and are they actually comparative to  
**Dean Nixon:** Sorry. So they didn't acquire anyone that does this tool.  
**Jason Bagley:** you?  
**Dean Nixon:** This is just something they developed themselves. So basically they've made a a friendlier front end to their admin import tool that they had forever. Um they've just kind of dumbed it down a little bit and um put it on the new UI.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** Um but it still doesn't still doesn't take care of all of the kind of what I'd call the user considerations. So it still has a number of database database driven kind of logics that have to be applied to things and it's still very focused around database tables as opposed to uh a business  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay,  
**Dean Nixon:** scenario.  
**Jason Bagley:** got you. And um what is your relationship like with MRI?  
   
 

### 00:25:25 {#00:25:25}

   
**Dean Nixon:** Very good.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Okay, cool. So, so they've obviously seen your product, they understand your product, they like your product, like there's they're happy for you to carry on with the way that you're building this, all of those  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah, more so I'd say more so on the e-connect front which we'll come on to um shortly.  
**Jason Bagley:** things.  
**Dean Nixon:** But eformms is something obviously we're we're only launching aggressively now. Um so we only have a handful of clients on on eformms  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Okay. Got you.  
**Dean Nixon:** currently.  
**Jason Bagley:** Um, anything else on e-forms that you feel like we haven't touched on that you'd like to to uh just explain that from a business side? We're going to get into like data and where things are at and what we're trying to do with it,  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah, I think not overly. I mean, you know, I think I think the kind of reflection from the last user conference that we went to,  
**Jason Bagley:** but  
**Dean Nixon:** uh, MIR user conference we went to,  
   
 

### 00:26:10

   
**Bjorn:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** you know, Bu and I both felt after the the sessions that we attended, we felt like we pretty much could just put a a booth up in the exhibition hall that just says MRI data imports. And I think we we'd attract a lot of nice and easy we'd attract a lot of uh a lot of attention just by doing something as simple as that. So we're quite keen to make sure the message any kind of messaging that we send out around eformms is is very simple and to the point uh on that Nice.  
**Jason Bagley:** So would you say that if I had to say to a person that like heavily uses MRI and And I said to him, "Hey, um, we need to import some data into MRI." It feels like almost like a swear word to them.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah, there could definitely be some some frustration. Yeah, for  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, cool. That's a good thing to  
**Bjorn:** there there are one or two very specific use cases where they do it like it's fine the user  
**Dean Nixon:** sure.  
   
 

### 00:26:59 {#00:26:59}

   
**Jason Bagley:** know.  
**Bjorn:** experience is fine uh obviously the general tools are frustrating there one or two pages within like it call it four pages out of 150 four data sets out of 150 where it's like pretty slick but the rest is all yeah high friction and then just a comment on people asking about our  
**Jason Bagley:** Wow. Okay.  
**Bjorn:** relationship with them. Um,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** they kind of operate in three. They kind of have AMIA, APAC, and then the Americas. Um, and we have kind of good relationships on all three fronts, but the Americas are kind of the most difficult to deal with, which is where we're wanting to aim e-formms at the moment. So, but yeah, we're very much we're very much we are official partners. Um,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** Econ is, if you go to their partner page, it says E-Connect um, rather than EBox. And there's nothing up there about Eforms. Uh, because they only we kind of just launched with the product. But yeah,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** there's opportunity to change that partner text as well on there kind of partner area.  
   
 

### 00:28:07

   
**Jason Bagley:** Nice.  
**Bjorn:** So, if people go on there, it's probably something we should have where they can see data in if you're going through the different partners.  
**Jason Bagley:** and outside of them so customers that obviously use MRI um do when they when they think of let's say ignoring the data import side of things what is it what is the overall feeling about MRI as as a piece of software that people are running their business is it like positive is it like ah this is pretty much the only thing we've got It is the thing that we have to use. Like what is the feeling around the product itself outside of the this massive pain point?  
**Dean Nixon:** I'd say it's difficult. I mean, MRI has been through a long over the last kind of 10 years, probably longer than that actually, probably probably 20 years. They've been through a process where they've been um they used to be owned by into it. So, in it are one of the big US obviously US software firms. Um, and they've been bought and sold by various different venture capitalists over the last kind of 15 15 or so years.  
   
 

### 00:29:16

   
**Dean Nixon:** Um, where the product's been kind of streamlined and as VCs do, they make it ultra profitable and and cut a lot of the investment out in terms of the uh the growth of the product. It seems to be I'd say more so probably since the chap who took over as a CEO kind chap called Pat Kalani. So I think he's been must be coming up to 10 years or maybe slightly longer than that since he's been CEO.  
**Bjorn:** Squeeze  
**Dean Nixon:** There's been a definite definite change in attitude to the company. It's been more positive um more embracing of the users but they have lost a lot of traction to  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** another competitor called Yardi.  
**Bjorn:** off.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Yi. Y can just spell that.  
**Dean Nixon:** Y A R D  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Cool. Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** I  
**Jason Bagley:** Interesting. Okay. Interesting. Um, cool. Yeah. Let's move on to econ. If you can just tell me about that, what that product does and who  
   
 

### 00:30:10 {#00:30:10}

   
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah, sure. So,  
**Jason Bagley:** serves.  
**Dean Nixon:** Econet was created out of a frustration from users who wanted to email correspondence to their tenants. So, ultimately, Big Ep solution, if you send your invoices out from it, it comes from an MRI software mailbox. it will come from MRI net source whatever um so it comes from there comes from there um and then there's very little way they can do in terms of branding of those emails um renaming of attachments um and obviously as it's all coming through one bulk mailbox you can't you can't track it either so there's no way for the these these large real estate companies who are sending out anything up to 20 30 40,000 invoices per month to make sure that their invoices are being delivered to the to the tenants. Obviously, a huge frustration. Um there there are other considerations as well. So clients had the requirement to um yeah to tailor some of those requirements, combine them together to add additional supporting information to those invoices. Um, so that that's where where econ was was born out of.  
   
 

### 00:31:27 {#00:31:27}

   
**Dean Nixon:** So we built a utility that allows uh us to hook up to the client's own email domains to send that email out to track it, make sure it's delivered. Um, we can secure documents. So we're able to encrypt the PDFs that are sent out to ensure that they can't be or not can't be, but makes it more difficult for them to be duplicated for fraud. The clients could obviously brand the whole email chain, anything from the the look and feel of the email content itself through to the attachments um to yeah to to make it reflective of their brand and and their requirements to have that that sort of  
**Jason Bagley:** Let's  
**Dean Nixon:** client experience. Started off with one one client just kind of um yeah mentioning it to  
**Jason Bagley:** go.  
**Dean Nixon:** me. I quickly remembered a number of frustrations from other clients. So we put that together. Um it's been very very popular in predominantly in the Australia region. Um I think we've got around 30 clients MRI clients in Australia that are using it.  
   
 

### 00:32:31

   
**Dean Nixon:** Um but it's used it's used used in all three regions right now. So uh APAC Europe and AMIA sorry and and uh US. Um  
**Jason Bagley:** You  
**Dean Nixon:** yeah.  
**Jason Bagley:** want  
**Bjorn:** It's part of the reason why we're focus we decided to focus on e-formms and America in this initial kind of push is because e-connect is is such an easy sale and such an easy crossell because it's such an obvious product. Um and so definitely I definitely want to be including it. Um, I do just in terms of visualizing kind of what Dean was talking about trying to  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah,  
**Bjorn:** figure out how to share my screen. I think I've just got too many  
**Jason Bagley:** it's like a little up arrow, I think, next to the camera there.  
**Bjorn:** tabs open in the background. So, it's giving me options. Um, if I can just tell the screen for a second again just kind of to help visualize it. Okay. Can you see this? Fantastic. Um, so obviously MRI has the ability to kind of send mails.  
   
 

### 00:33:37 {#00:33:37}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Bjorn:** That's what Dean was saying. And then we kind of insert ourselves into that flow. And the reason for that is because MRIs MRIs emails look like this. Um, just to blow that up a bit. It's like you you're a property a large property company. Um, you're sending out 40,000 invoices and they're coming from, so I keep clicking. They're coming from mirroretssource.com. This is an invoice or a late letter or a statement or, you know, whatever. It's not really clear. And then they have a kind of fixed text in their emails. So then obviously you can say in the email, hey, this is an invoice. It's kind of relatively clear, but really doesn't match the kind of brand size, anything that these big companies are sending. It's a it's uh to the point where like the the fact that this gap has existed and still exists for us to operate in is surprising for a company that's operating at that site that they they're kind of so happy with it being sending out such poor um customer experiences on their customers behalf then obviously kind of getting e-connect in this is the experience you're getting you're having like you know it says it's coming from you says your unit number these is all custom.  
   
 

### 00:34:58

   
**Bjorn:** You can kind of customize this. It says it's an invoice, the statement. It says your name. You can put in random bits of information, custom counts and numbers. It gets sent from your email address, which is obviously much nicer in terms of customer experience, fraud. Um, yeah, obviously I said you can add all that. uh you can send multiple documents instead of so if someone has you know 30 units they can get 30 invoices and one on invoice and a statement instead of getting 30 individual emails that look like this uh that aren't very clear and then obviously huge in the local market very market  
**Jason Bagley:** All  
**Bjorn:** specific the fact that we can kind of lock down those invoices for for editing and I won't yeah I won't go on from there but just  
**Jason Bagley:** right.  
**Bjorn:** in terms of visualizing I think it's this this in particular just the this  
**Jason Bagley:** H  
**Bjorn:** slide transition from like they're used to that seeing this is a huge kind of we've gotten here once with a client um kind of 10 minutes into our sales meeting and they just went like yeah done we'll take it we don't need to see the rest um and so obviously that again just being a massive point of friction  
   
 

### 00:36:11

   
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah, I mean I can't wait to get this landing page before and be before screen and after screen. Like I mean literally that feels like done. Like you said 10 minutes in. We just need to put before and after. Connect chat to us. will get your emails looking like this and done pretty much.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah,  
**Jason Bagley:** Of  
**Bjorn:** we've got to be um it's an interesting one because in sales calls it's fine,  
**Jason Bagley:** course,  
**Bjorn:** but obviously we are we are because we are official partners. We can't have a website that says like MRI sucks.  
**Jason Bagley:** yes.  
**Bjorn:** Talk to us, you know, as much as we'd like to.  
**Jason Bagley:** Sure.  
**Bjorn:** So, we got to be very careful.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Bjorn:** But I definitely think there's opportunity there to do something like that.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah. Yep. It's not even But we don't have to say they suck. We just said this is what your emails are currently. We're going to make them look like this. That's all, you know, but anyway, yeah, we can definitely that's quite cool.  
   
 

### 00:37:00 {#00:37:00}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Um, okay. And then, um, oh,  
**Bjorn:** Hey,  
**Jason Bagley:** I guess one question, it's more like a on the business side of this is is do you think the reason how does MRI price how do they charge? Is it like just Yeah, just cuz and the reason I'm asking that question is is it the reason that the way that they charge for things in the software is because them fixing these problems is not actually going to bring them any more revenue because it not they're not going to charge more all of a sudden because they've built out a better looking email.  
**Dean Nixon:** I think that's part of the reason. Um the other reason I think just generally is that they've got a lot more going on in the product that they're focusing on and this is kind of bottom of the sort of the lowest priority like you  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** know they have to deal with you know in in AMIA for instance there's new standard being rolled out called  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** e invoicing which uh is a way of doing XML based invoicing that government certain government authorities require now.  
   
 

### 00:38:01

   
**Dean Nixon:** Um so it's it's them keeping pace with kind of legislative changes um and  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** functionality and bugs in the system. I mean they have you know they are thousands of users that that are logging bugs on a day-to-day basis and obviously making sure that the products are are up to date and they're bug free or you know as bug free as possible and keeping pace. Um they've had a large amount of technical debt ultimately. I mean they recently announced their latest version which which I don't know if any of you are technical minded at all but they they removed the support for Visual Basic from their latest version. So that's that's some of their code base. Um yeah it's uh it's  
**Jason Bagley:** Wow. Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** shocking.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, cool. Is it a is it a desktop platform or is it web  
**Dean Nixon:** So it's a web.  
**Jason Bagley:** based?  
**Dean Nixon:** So it used to be like a Windows-based application which transitioned to a to a web product. Um so their latest release really pulled away all the all the kind of dependency on  
   
 

### 00:38:58 {#00:38:58}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** on the the desktop version.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** Um it's been web for for a good while but with a large dependency on the administration and configuration on on their web product but they're now finally pulling sorry the Windows product. So they're finally pulling away from the Windows product now completely.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, cool. Got you. Um, and then just in terms of how the can you give me some rough costing on how much it costs for a customer to I guess purchase is it a monthly thing for eformms and e-connect so we can understand that.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah, you got that pricing pure  
**Jason Bagley:** I mean, if you have the pricing, you just send it to us. Then we'll we'll make a note to ask you for it if  
**Dean Nixon:** basically we for econ we charge on lease volumes.  
**Jason Bagley:** it's  
**Dean Nixon:** So obviously we know you know someone has a thousand users thousand leases we know roughly what the level of correspondences they're sending out. So we we price accordingly. Um but yeah it ranges uh depending on lease volumes and we kind of have  
   
 

### 00:40:01 {#00:40:01}

   
**Jason Bagley:** okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** tiers as they go up.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** Eforms is based on user volume. So obviously we'll have the number of users entering into the system.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** Um so that's kind of user based. Generally MRI software itself its license fees are based on uh combination of both users and and lease volumes.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Got you. Cool. I mean, I don't think we need to talk about value propositioning because we've got a lot of that from what we've just been discussing. From an ideal customer perspective, I think the first thing is they need to be using MRI software like it's quite important number one. And then obvious what else about um the customer? So I know we're targeting America. So that's as a starting point. So that that I know that we want to be working on. What else about that that customer?  
**Dean Nixon:** So, so I'd say primarily it would be anyone with kind of I'd say 3 to 400 plus leases as a minimum would be an ideal ideal client.  
   
 

### 00:41:11 {#00:41:11}

   
**Dean Nixon:** Typically commercial commercial real estate or mixed use.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** Uh the residential, you know, we'll have someone you have one client who's maybe residential owner and they'll they'll have 10,000 units. uh but their budget will be tiny because they're all residential units versus you'll have someone with 600 commercial units that  
**Jason Bagley:** Wait.  
**Dean Nixon:** will quite comfortably afford the product because it's commercial versus residential. So, uh the commercial the commercial space for us, commercial, mixeduse or or retail um are kind of the sweet spot type clients for us really. Um yeah, I mean beyond anything else you can think of. I mean it's kind of volume and and sector really more than anything else, isn't it?  
**Bjorn:** I think um we're trying to have less of a scattershot for e-forms. I think that's accurate. I think when we get on to when we get on to e-connect or even e-forms in other regions, we'll kind of broaden that slightly. But I think that yeah, largeish clients or medium to large clients in kind of commercial industrial space using MRI PMX.  
   
 

### 00:42:18

   
**Bjorn:** Uh almost all those qualifiers are going to expand when we move on to the other product.  
**Jason Bagley:** So, what do you mean by uh MRI PMX? Is that a different product?  
**Dean Nixon:** Sorry that's their flagship product is PMX is the main product that we so mentioned that they they they like to acquire they have about I think it's something like 150 products in total uh MRI software themselves. So if you say I use MRI maybe in Europe, people will think you're use talking about products called Cube or a product called Horizon. Whereas you say I use MRI in North America, nine times out of 10 you'll probably get MRI PMX, which is our the product that we're primarily focusing on. Um we've expanded our we've expanded e-connect to use um a product called MDA or property central in South Africa because there quite a large um tech base of clients there that we're trying to trying to work with. Um but the focus at the moment is PMX and North America which is will be the  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** majority.  
   
 

### 00:43:20 {#00:43:20}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Um and then just on the eformms side is what is the the you've mentioned a few time accounting journals and accounting on on being is that one of the biggest uh I guess problems that you've seen and that people like to solve that one versus other type of imports.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah, accounting journals is one kind of no-brainer. Um, leasing is another. Um, and there's account what we call um, so invoice or receipt batches is the other thing. So something called CM batches are the kind of three main I guess and yeah hierarchy data.  
**Jason Bagley:** see him.  
**Dean Nixon:** So unit yeah unit data um lease data etc. Sorry Bill I cut you off  
**Bjorn:** Yeah, I was going to say the same.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** then  
**Bjorn:** So like building building unit lease data lease is a massive use case because they can be quite the flows can be quite complicated. So the different types of flows we do have kind of because it's the kind of Google forms we can build forms for anything we do have kind of out of the box forms or the common use cases um things like journals or cm batches that kind of accounting style stuff is valuable just because of the volume of the files people are uploading and they have to capture them one at a time in MRI  
   
 

### 00:44:27

   
**Jason Bagley:** Mhm.  
**Bjorn:** which is obviously incredibly frustrating given like you can have a journal that has 5,000 lines you know Um then on the lease or property side, it's just because they constantly have people coming in and out and the the approval flow is more complicated. So it's like two the the the wins for the two teams are very different. They both kind of primarily trying to get a product or trying to get data in. Uh but the win is like oh we have this all audited the complex flows. We're not stuck with users in a particular system. One of the advantages, we didn't talk about eformms, is that you can have users that aren't MRI users interfacing with your data, grouping it, and that's quite a big one for some users as well. Um, whereas the journals are just they're like, hey, I'm tired of typing 5,000 lines.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah, I would be tired too. Um, cool.  
**Bjorn:** Then the other big other big area is accounts payable.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** So like adding adding vendors to your system especially when you have kind of tens of thousands of vendors again that approval flow.  
   
 

### 00:45:38 {#00:45:38}

   
**Bjorn:** So those there are a bunch of use cases around those but those are the kind of three areas is um accounting use cases, property and lease data use cases and then kind of vendor and accounts payable use cases are the three sections we tend to operate in.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, perfect. Okay, cool. I'm happy with that. Uh, tell Lauren, anything here that any other questions before we move on?  
**Lauren Peacock:** Just a question from my side. Um, in terms of the the kind of people we're targeting that to get in front of you, right? I'm assuming from a a financial perspective with all of the journals, etc. CFO, they'll understand the use case immediately. They know exactly what you're trying to solve. In terms of the the leasing data and that sort of thing, is that similar or is there a particular role within these like uh real estate businesses that you know of that you're targeting that you end up dealing with that make these decisions?  
**Dean Nixon:** Typically, it's head of finance, CFO, as they'll have kind of operational oversight of both the leasing data as well.  
   
 

### 00:46:40

   
**Lauren Peacock:** Got you.  
**Dean Nixon:** But another area that I've found success in generally is with um kind of whoever's head of kind of asset management within these organizations.  
**Lauren Peacock:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** So the people actually responsible for the bricks and mortar uh would be particularly interested in  
**Lauren Peacock:** Yes.  
**Dean Nixon:** the in the kind of leasing data and the hierarchal data. So the building unit lease  
**Lauren Peacock:** Got  
**Dean Nixon:** data  
**Bjorn:** a property manager.  
**Lauren Peacock:** you.  
**Bjorn:** Often often they're sectored often they would be like the commercial property manager or the retail property manager or the residential property manager and or director. Those that those kind of decision makers  
**Lauren Peacock:** Perfect. Uh Jason, just a heads up. You're not sharing anymore.  
**Jason Bagley:** Good point. Thank you. Okay, we're back. Cool. Okay. Um, now just in terms of sort of we just want to understand a little bit like where you're at. Some stuff you might not know. It might be a bit all over the place. Not sure of it.  
   
 

### 00:47:43 {#00:47:43}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Don't have any. Um, just in terms of the eBox, the business itself. So I guess I know it's quite new but like can you tell me a little bit like size of the business maybe how much revenue you currently are doing if you don't mind sharing that with us people in the team um rough number of clients you know what size your pipeline is just that type of stuff so we can understand where things are things are at. And then we'll get on to marketing tech and tools and stuff that you guys do use or don't use.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah. Um team is easy.  
**Bjorn:** In terms  
**Dean Nixon:** So team is 11 people  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** currently.  
**Jason Bagley:** Rough number of clients, customers.  
**Bjorn:** 42 unique clients across the four products. Um, in fact,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** 42 unique clients across the two products. It's fine because they're all users. Um, and some of them are using both. So, kind of.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah, probably something like like 52 individual contracts or 57 somewhere around there.  
   
 

### 00:48:55 {#00:48:55}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** 47 47  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah.  
**Jason Bagley:** Um and then just in terms of your billing, do is do they pay annually or monthly?  
**Dean Nixon:** Yes,  
**Jason Bagley:** Annual.  
**Dean Nixon:** I knew I knew in advance.  
**Jason Bagley:** No, there's no monthly billing at all. No. Okay, got  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah.  
**Jason Bagley:** you  
**Bjorn:** um we will do a non so it's annual in advance in Jan and then if we sign you on kind of later in the year then we'll do a pro Roger for that year and then they will fall into Jan.  
**Jason Bagley:** now.  
**Bjorn:** Um the only billing we do monthly is if there's some consulting that needs to happen they want an improvement they  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** want a new form built um then we charge for that.  
**Jason Bagley:** Ah, how much consulting work if you take percentage of annual revenue would you say is your consulting?  
**Bjorn:** The last 3 months it's been about  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** 10%.  
**Jason Bagley:** It's not that. And is that something you want to grow or is it just it must just sort of roughly stay there?  
   
 

### 00:49:56 {#00:49:56}

   
**Jason Bagley:** It's it's not something you're actually trying to  
**Bjorn:** Yeah,  
**Jason Bagley:** push.  
**Bjorn:** it's it's a tool to get the ARR up. So it's it's nice and we're happy to be doing it, but we're we're quite willing to sacrifice it to kind of lock in the the license. So as a percentage, we're not trying to get it up.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** If it if it stays at 10% as we scale, that's fine. We don't the AR is the big focus for  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Cool. Got you.  
**Bjorn:** us.  
**Jason Bagley:** Um and then uh your pipeline at the moment, how roughly how many leads are currently sitting in your in your in your pipeline that you're working? Um, and how many leads roughly do you get per month?  
**Bjorn:** I don't have a leads per month. Our leads across the heat map were probably sitting on  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** about 30 30 open leads of which most are pretty cold. And we've got kind of four that are like hot slash expecting a signature in the next two months. Um this this is across both products.  
   
 

### 00:51:07

   
**Bjorn:** So I'd have to kind of drill down just to get into the exact e forms. uh e-forms I think we have two two hot and very few a handful of  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** kind of cold leads um and then that's excluding some  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** lists that we have that we've spoken to you about which I guess we could consider leads we haven't started engaging with them yet but we we have kind of a few hundred companies across the world that we know either are users of PMX or have been users of PMX in the last few years Um, and that that list in particular, the kind of re most recent North America one is particularly interesting to us for this kind of  
**Dean Nixon:** Stay right.  
**Bjorn:** next  
**Jason Bagley:** got you.  
**Bjorn:** step.  
**Jason Bagley:** Um, and then I mean are you would you be able to share just a revenue like an AR number with us?  
**Bjorn:** I'm sitting in an open office at the moment. So, not right now.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, got you. Cool. Um, yeah. I mean, it's not because I'm like nosy.  
   
 

### 00:52:13

   
**Jason Bagley:** It helps to understand where you're at and and how for us to push on what do we need to push on like the hardest because we've had it before where we haven't asked clients this question and then they go off on a tangent asking us to do a whole bunch of stuff and we happily go do that and then they come back three months and like we need sales like today. And I'm like, "Guys, why didn't you tell me that in day one and you told me your business was actually had like this three or six month runway type of thing, you know?" So then obviously they cancelled with us, but because they didn't want to share that in the beginning because it's I guess embarrassing or they're not allowed to or whatever the story was. So that's why we sort of asked it so we can be hard on you guys going stop giving us things that are not going to move the needle if the moving the needle is the most important thing in the next like three months. That's really just why why we did it.  
   
 

### 00:52:58

   
**Bjorn:** Yeah.  
**Jason Bagley:** Um,  
**Bjorn:** Yeah. We we can provide some more information.  
**Jason Bagley:** okay.  
**Bjorn:** Um I guess as a as a very quick summary, uh we're we're still kind of in a phase where we're needing funding,  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Bjorn:** but we're not going to run out of funding anytime soon uh given our positioning in the group.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** So we're uh we're here for the next 12  
**Jason Bagley:** Sure. Understand that. Okay.  
**Bjorn:** months.  
**Jason Bagley:** Good. Okay. Cool. And then the last two then the question is like sort of your forecast for the next 12 months. So um what does the I guess if we want to talk maybe do you have a forecast like we going to we want to grow this business by X right does that look like a bigger team as well so do you have a rough number of like team because that'll maybe help us and understand numbers from that perspective and then you're on what did you say 42 clients across those two products do you have a number in your head in terms of is it a number of clients by the end of the year or is it more like a revenue number and then if it's a revenue number okay open office you can't share it with me but I just want to know is and you have even like a 12 month like goal forecast for  
   
 

### 00:54:07

   
**Bjorn:** Yeah,  
**Jason Bagley:** this  
**Bjorn:** it's a it's a revenue number. We have a we have a a client number that we've kind of estimated would be that revenue number, but revenue is the revenue is the name of the game.  
**Jason Bagley:** yeah  
**Bjorn:** That that ARR number in particular. Um like I said, we're we're more interested in growing the ARR than we are the consulting. So suddenly suddenly we find ourselves in place where we're doing 60% consulting, you know, we'll take it because we're it's kind of income, but clearly we're doing something wrong because that's not what we're trying to do.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** It's  
**Jason Bagley:** Right.  
**Bjorn:** um uh I can get you those percentages.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. So, okay. Revenue.  
**Bjorn:** We we've got those where we want to kind of want to get you in the next six months.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** So,  
**Jason Bagley:** Cool. Okay. I'll make a note to get that from you. Um, and  
**Bjorn:** one of the numbers that we thought was kind of we're hoping to achieve from this campaign is  
   
 

### 00:54:50 {#00:54:50}

   
**Jason Bagley:** then  
**Bjorn:** um we started off saying, okay, we can get in front of 80 clients in North America. And if we're able to get in front of 80 clients, we have I should have the numbers in front of me and I don't. But, you know,  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** 80 clients probably means X turnover probably means probably means probably means um but we're quite confident that if we can get in front of just like a an initial sales pitch to 80 clients in North America, uh we're like a four away with this business just in terms of our kind of success so far. when we do get in front of the  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** right.  
**Jason Bagley:** Is that 80 client? Okay. Yeah. With AR. So that's 80 clients in a year. 80 new 80 get in front of 80 clients uh for the year.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Cool. Because that'll turn into X number of AR revenue. Okay. Got you. That's a nice goal. Um Okay.  
   
 

### 00:55:46 {#00:55:46}

   
**Bjorn:** Yeah.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. I mean  
**Bjorn:** We'd have to do a lot more in like Apac because they're much smaller.  
**Jason Bagley:** just  
**Bjorn:** But yeah, 80 North American clients. I think I think we said lands us 20\. Maybe that was a bit ambitious, but we've had we have had a higher a higher success a higher close rate than that so far.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay,  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah. Watch  
**Jason Bagley:** cool.  
**Bjorn:** So,  
**Dean Nixon:** me.  
**Jason Bagley:** Cool. And do you uh do you track I think I did ask you this, but do you how do you track like do you have a CRM that you run or just an Excel file that you track where someone is in the the the process in the pipeline?  
**Bjorn:** Uh we use pipe drive.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** Um I've you've h I say that we kind of use but we have pipe drive. Um I'm getting a lot I'm getting a lot better at it.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Let's be honest here. The data is not up to date,  
   
 

### 00:56:32 {#00:56:32}

   
**Bjorn:** So we so it's it's gotten to a place where it's pretty good now.  
**Jason Bagley:** right?  
**Bjorn:** That's basically like you know my in my court and we've just been uh we caught this company kind of mid midway in the air. So we had a lot of things in the go,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** but it's we're pretty much using pipe drive for tracking sales at this stage.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay,  
**Bjorn:** It just means historical data is not that  
**Jason Bagley:** that's fine. Okay, cool. Um,  
**Bjorn:** good.  
**Jason Bagley:** cool. And and you happy with with using pipe drives? wasn't something you inherited that you're looking to switch. No,  
**Bjorn:** No,  
**Jason Bagley:** you're happy with that.  
**Bjorn:** we inherited another system I didn't like. So it's it's ours.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, cool.  
**Bjorn:** It's completely under our control.  
**Jason Bagley:** Nice. Okay, perfect. Okay, so that's obviously part of your your sort of I guess tech stack. Uh you're a Microsoft house. I understand that. So any other tools that apps that you use specifically from a marketing and a sales perspective?  
   
 

### 00:57:28 {#00:57:28}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Like is there anything here like do you have a newsletter database that's sitting in Mailchimp? Do you have I don't know is there any tools that your Google Analytics I guess that's not really you don't really have a website but I'm assuming access to that from the open box side.  
**Dean Nixon:** Uh, not currently.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** We're pretty much just Pipe Drive and Office 365  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Cool.  
**Dean Nixon:** currently.  
**Bjorn:** We probably have access to quite a lot of tools that we aren't using via the group, but yeah,  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** we're we're running quite lean  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay,  
**Bjorn:** mode.  
**Jason Bagley:** cool. Um,  
**Bjorn:** What else? We use Loom. We use Loom for recording demos,  
**Jason Bagley:** nice.  
**Bjorn:** I guess.  
**Dean Nixon:** and and Zenesk for support.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. No,  
**Dean Nixon:** That's  
**Bjorn:** Yeah,  
**Jason Bagley:** that that's useful to know. Um,  
**Bjorn:** but we're not married to either of  
**Jason Bagley:** okay.  
**Bjorn:** those.  
**Lauren Peacock:** Um, sorry,  
**Dean Nixon:** no  
**Lauren Peacock:** just a question around your sales process.  
   
 

### 00:58:27 {#00:58:27}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Lauren Peacock:** Obviously, Bjorn, you sort of managing the CRM and all of the software. Who is your sales? Is it just the two of you sort of closing sales at the moment and driving those conversations? Do you have anyone else that's sort of doing any meeting setup or anything like that or is it just purely the two of  
**Bjorn:** across the group.  
**Lauren Peacock:** you?  
**Bjorn:** Um, so kind of formally it's just the two of us. Across the group, um, we have individuals that know the product kind of relatively well and are exposed to other businesses and therefore kind of tee us up, um, make introductions, sometimes have an initial quick meeting to just assess requirements. Um, and that happens quite ado. I mean, there's maybe four of those across the group,  
**Lauren Peacock:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** but they're not primarily really focused on this business at all. They're just happy to see examples of opportunity. So DN me video Guys,  
**Lauren Peacock:** Got it. Got it.  
**Taylor Lawrence:** Before we move on, um I know your closing rate is pretty good,  
   
 

### 00:59:18 {#00:59:18}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Cool.  
**Taylor Lawrence:** but um when it comes to closing, is there any objections people have that come up frequently when why they don't go ahead with your  
**Bjorn:** I've  
**Taylor Lawrence:** services?  
**Bjorn:** never seen someone not some high friction points or I guess people ask for sock  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** compliance. We we don't do sock, we do ISO. Um regional hosting,  
**Taylor Lawrence:** Oops.  
**Bjorn:** we don't currently host in America. But that's I mean as soon as we have a big client say no for that reason, we'll solve it. So it's these are just friction areas, but they're not necessarily nos. uh price. Small clients find us kind of too expensive or particularly small clients and so we've had to kind of look at that quite aggressively in  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** APAC.  
**Dean Nixon:** No other than that, that's pretty much pretty much it.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** And like I say, we we addressed the sock issue with our ISO 27,0001 certification. Um the the the region hosting is not an issue. You know, if we have a client today and say we won't sign unless it's North America, fine.  
   
 

### 01:00:38

   
**Dean Nixon:** We're determined that we're we're we're on board with the region. So we'll set up spin up a North American instance. It's just that all of our clients are currently Eura and APAC. So except for two  
**Taylor Lawrence:** Okay. So, you can pretty much make a workaround solution,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** three.  
**Taylor Lawrence:** which is good news.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah. So the the only actual nos we've gotten other than that that were due to us  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah.  
**Bjorn:** and not due to kind of their own taking a different direction um are smaller clients saying we don't have budget for this we'd love it and those those are typically Australia APAC South America I mean Australia Apac South Africa yeah not so much Europe and America  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, cool. Uh, I was going to ask one more question. I cannot remember that what it was. We'll move on until that. Um, okay. Okay. So, normally, you know, I know this is obviously like sort of a new business that you're now pushing.  
   
 

### 01:01:40 {#01:01:40}

   
**Jason Bagley:** So, there's probably not a lot of stuff that you've from a growth perspective have have done in the past. There's not much there to go with, but um and what hasn't or hasn't worked, right? So, we can just maybe sort of go through this quite quickly. It's sort of a case of just trying to figure out like what have you tried in the past that like you're like, "Hell no, we never doing this again." And we've had, you know, there's some always something that maybe a client has done. It's just never worked. They've tried it multiple times. let us never suggest that. They'll just roll their eyes at us.  
**Dean Nixon:** I'm sorry.  
**Jason Bagley:** Um and then sort of what are you currently doing? Um other than obviously speaking to us and starting to work with us. Um and then I think we do have sort of your 12 month goals in terms of number of meetings. I just want to figure out if there's anything else outside of a marketing sales perspective that we should be aware of from that you're trying to do in the business.  
   
 

### 01:02:25 {#01:02:25}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Whether that's grow the team, you're trying to whatever launch a new product or whatever just so we understand like other things that are potentially going on. So is there anything in the past that you've tried or you have seen even maybe on the open box side like we don't do that as a business or won't try that again in as a business or hasn't worked for us.  
**Bjorn:** We've gone to conferences under the kind of open box banner. Um, and in America in particular, I think it was a bad move. And so it is it's obviously cheaper, but in we're sending eight people from one company instead of six and two. Um but in terms of actually kind of getting the attention and the traction and access to  
**Jason Bagley:** Mhm.  
**Bjorn:** um you know their demo slots um and things we didn't have access to because we went as a software provider company. We went as a consultancy not a not the products company. Um I think that was a big miss. I think uh kind of Dean and I both have the ability as well as some other people in our team to kind of get up on stage  
   
 

### 01:03:24 {#01:03:24}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** and put on a show. Um, and so that kind of ability  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah,  
**Bjorn:** to  
**Dean Nixon:** message was just lost, right? It was just lost in the in the noise. There was nothing screaming, you know, if we had a monster truck with confetti can cannon screen data imports, we would have nailed it. But because it was just open box software,  
**Bjorn:** Anything  
**Dean Nixon:** people obviously didn't think to to ask us. And you know, we did our best to try and try and hook people as they walking past, but it wasn't obvious that, you know, we had a solution to fill this  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** gap.  
**Jason Bagley:** Anything I mean anything else that that has or hasn't worked or is working at the moment?  
**Bjorn:** on the anything you tried on top up that didn't  
**Dean Nixon:** So, I was just trying to think. I mean, I tend to I mean, we didn't have a huge amount.  
**Bjorn:** work.  
**Dean Nixon:** We did some marketing into the US for econ with topup um which wasn't particularly successful.  
   
 

### 01:04:30 {#01:04:30}

   
**Dean Nixon:** The reason it wasn't particularly on econ in North America is that uh North America is still very still very stuck in the dark ages in terms of payments with the US. So they're very check based and they have clearing houses that do different things. So there's kind of agencies that kind of fit into that into that that kind of process that that Bjon showed where MRI generates it stuff out and then sends the bit where econ is. Sometimes they have agencies like payment agencies that deal with some of the correspondent sending and things like that.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** So econ is is not that I don't think the market's in a mature enough position right now for for econ.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** So which is why we want to focus on e-forms because there definitely is a requirement for e-forms in the US. Uh EMIA and APAC for Econ definitely there's you know we we're already working with a number of clients in that space.  
**Jason Bagley:** Mhm. Okay. Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** Um  
**Jason Bagley:** Cool. Uh, sorry.  
   
 

### 01:05:31 {#01:05:31}

   
**Jason Bagley:** What was what is popup? Is that like an agency or  
**Dean Nixon:** sorry topup.  
**Jason Bagley:** a  
**Dean Nixon:** So that was the that was the entity that open box bought software from. So I used to be the CTO of that that  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, got you. Cool. Okay. Um, and then yeah, lastly,  
**Dean Nixon:** entity.  
**Jason Bagley:** in terms of like your any 12-month goals other than the ones you sort of given us here, is there anything else that you guys are on the behind the scenes trying to work on, get done by the end of the year that has made this year a success?  
**Bjorn:** trying to as a broad goal, we're trying to keep the team lean. So, you're talking about team growth. Um, but if we doubled our revenue, you know, we shouldn't really grow our team by more than 20%. So, there's kind of a we're trying to get that exponential growth. Um, and then one other thing,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** and so a lot of that's kind of just good processes, right?  
   
 

### 01:06:20 {#01:06:20}

   
**Bjorn:** good processes, good people. Um just on the to go back slightly,  
**Jason Bagley:** Mhm.  
**Bjorn:** what are you currently doing? One of the things that we found works really well is um just the practical kind of image of things. So we used to when we onboarded the products, we used to actually take people through a sales demo. We're like here's the product and here's the new click through. Um and obviously just the decision makers, it's like too much detail for them, too many screens. that like we don't really care. And so we we've kind of got to a point where the those slides I was showing you earlier are part of our econ sales at least. Um and we now make most get most signatures without anyone ever seeing the actual product  
**Jason Bagley:** Mhm.  
**Bjorn:** just because of that right going like listen this is what you know it looks like this you know this is ridiculous this is what it can look like and then we talk about a bunch of scenarios. Um so that kind of very like simple visualization um solutionbased or like friction focused selling rather than actually getting into the product.  
   
 

### 01:07:23

   
**Bjorn:** We haven't really got that right in e-forms. Eformms is a little bit more impressive to actually open up but uh on the  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** econ we pretty much make most sales without ever opening the product.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Makes sense. Uh yeah. And then I guess just I'm just going to come back to one more sec. Anything else on this be on the 12 month stuff?  
**Bjorn:** Yeah, there is I'll get you the number of uh I'll get you some more concrete goals in terms of what we've put down in our forecasting.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, cool. No worries. All righty. Okay. Um think if there's anything else that I need. No, I think we're good. Okay. So, the next step here is um what we want to obviously we're going to start where we're going to start working on um off the back of this. The first thing I want to say there's two we sometimes we've got clients that we've realized there's a big gap somewhere and we've got a couple of workshops.  
   
 

### 01:08:26 {#01:08:26}

   
**Jason Bagley:** We're building out more workshops uh internally for for various things. We've got two at the moment in terms of um I'm just this one here. We've got an ICP workshop because we do have clients that go, "Oh, yes, anyone in the US that has a pulse uh and you know has access to clean water." And then we're like, "Okay, that's great, but we're not like Coca-Cola. You know this, you don't have budget to put a sign on every street corner. So, let's not pretend that that's a great ICP." So, we got a very good cool workshop to figure that out. But you guys, it's very clear. is understandable because there's that big you have to be an MRI like a user, right? So, and we've got that quite clear. So, this isn't really going to push us and help us um to be honest. Um and then we've got a sales process workshop. I sort of have alluded to it once or twice and I I I do double down on this a little bit because everyone says their sales process is amazing and they look after it and it's great and they, you know, process works and we close close a lot of deals, high percentage.  
   
 

### 01:09:28

   
**Jason Bagley:** I think it's a lot of referrals probably that you've said there, but um so there's the sales process sort of workshop. We just run through how you do sales. So from the lead coming in uh to showing some form of interest to actually closing that deal and the handoff to I guess starting. So we just run through that understand how you do it. And there's always maybe some gaps in there, but I don't think understand where you're at.  
**Bjorn:** Listen,  
**Jason Bagley:** It's not the most urgent thing, but I think at some point I'm going to poke holes in in the fact that your pipe drive and go, I think there's some work we can help here. Let's run it. It's only like 30 45 minutes, but let's not that's not the main starting point here without a doubt. So, I'm going to put this.  
**Bjorn:** now our eformms process definitely has some work to to get it there.  
**Jason Bagley:** Ah,  
**Bjorn:** So happy with it.  
**Jason Bagley:** okay. Nice, nice, nice. Um, so yeah, that we definitely do.  
   
 

### 01:10:18 {#01:10:18}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Like there's a few others I know that not now. This one is a not now, I would say. So, let me pop this in here. We will get to that in the next for the couple of weeks, I would say, maybe. Um, and then before I suggest some of the things, is there something super urgent that you're like, "Guys, I need this slide created by Tuesday because I got a conference coming up or anything that you like just jump on this please, so we can get this ticked off before we working on I know we want to talk about the website and the outreach we do in a sec. Just want to find out if there's any massive red help. H help. Can we get this done for you  
**Bjorn:** Yeah,  
**Jason Bagley:** quickly?  
**Bjorn:** just those three. I guess the the way we see it and and happy to kind of defer to you is that our main goal now is getting getting that outreach happening this,  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Bjorn:** you know, quarter. Um, in we were thinking a targeted email campaign, but let's discuss.  
   
 

### 01:11:11 {#01:11:11}

   
**Bjorn:** And we thought,  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** well, in order to have that, we need a website. And in order to have the website,  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Bjorn:** we need to have kind of transitioned into eBox because we cannot market aggressively under the openbox software like we may not. Um and so we I think the most important thing in my head um is that we need to get that kind of eBox branding or just eBox identity out. And so we'll be kind of changing our support emails,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** sending out something to the existing clients saying, "Hey guys, this is who we are." you know, changing it on the on the MRI partner website.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** Um, so just that that kind of what I'm hoping will be a pretty quick rebrand just so we  
**Jason Bagley:** Mhm.  
**Bjorn:** then can move on to the other two but with with the main goal of being obviously getting that kind of  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** targeted marketing out.  
**Jason Bagley:** Perfect. Okay.  
**Dean Nixon:** We were considering we're just doing a release of the Econ latest version of the Econ software.  
   
 

### 01:11:59 {#01:11:59}

   
**Jason Bagley:** So,  
**Dean Nixon:** We're considering doing kind of a a marketing based information type newsletter out to the client saying, "Oh, we're now eBox and by the way, here's a new release of the software and blah blah blah  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay,  
**Dean Nixon:** blah.  
**Jason Bagley:** sounds good. Where are you at with the the rebrand to eBox? Is there a logo? Is there anything on that side or you'd need help from us to in from  
**Bjorn:** Yeah,  
**Dean Nixon:** Pretty  
**Bjorn:** we've got a logo.  
**Jason Bagley:** that?  
**Bjorn:** We've got a URL. That's about it.  
**Dean Nixon:** much it though really. So we're finished,  
**Bjorn:** We've got email addresses.  
**Dean Nixon:** right?  
**Bjorn:** Yeah. What else is  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay,  
**Bjorn:** there?  
**Jason Bagley:** we've got a logo that like signed off. Happy with we're going with that.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah. It's not the one you have, but it's similar. So,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay,  
**Bjorn:** but we have a final  
**Jason Bagley:** you've got a f. Okay, perfect. Uh, so you got a logo, you got even you got a domain.  
   
 

### 01:12:57 {#01:12:57}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Good. Well done. That's I think a starting point to any good business. Um, okay. So then then I think it is a case of us like then I think there's a there's there's a bit of a roll out here, right? So you've got the there's the website. Yes, we want to we chatted that chat about that in a second. Um um which then will obviously while we're getting that website up and running, we can build out everything we need to do from the outreach side of things. There's a bit of infrastructure we need to set up which we'll help with. We'll get that done for you. Uh mailing. So I think that's pretty useful to the current clients potentially um and prospects that you even have even if they've gone cold um with branding and all of that on on that mailer for example um is there anything that so just to go back to the band is there anything more you want off of that so do you want a very simple would it would it help be helpful it I mean I would say it would maybe even for us to be honest with you like bit more helpful having a basic brand guideline so this is your logo But these are the fonts we want to use.  
   
 

### 01:14:06 {#01:14:06}

   
**Jason Bagley:** These are the colors scheme that we have we want to use. Just so that it helps us whenever we're creating any collateral. We're not going what colors can we use? And if we working with our design on our team, it's like am I allowed to use this color? I found this on this website here. I don't know because I know there's no sort of guidelines on that.  
**Bjorn:** So the plan was to kind of take the to duplicate as much as possible from open box and then to kind of take some of the screws out and you know get rid of some of the rules that that were restricting us.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** Um the part of the reason why we had we gave you an initial website  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** design.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** Um and and part of the reason kind of a very rough V1 part of the reason we did that is uh you know kind of our our design internal marketing team said you know you never go to a marketing company and not have a design for them.  
   
 

### 01:14:56

   
**Bjorn:** Um and I think we really like the fact that you kind of went as as  
**Jason Bagley:** Jeez,  
**Bjorn:** um not trying to put words in your mouth but like this isn't very good. We're going to do our own thing and we we really liked what you did. So, uh, in terms of kind of all of that,  
**Jason Bagley:** that  
**Bjorn:** like we're we're happy to duplicate where possible to make it simpler. Um, but the last thing I want to do is kind of get in the way of your creativity or be kind of like putting a noose around you or limiting you. So, uh, in terms of if we're wanting if we think the best thing forward is to be creating a brand guideline, uh, that's always going to end up going past the likes of Dom just to make sure she's happy with it because we'll we'll always be an affiliated company.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes, got  
**Bjorn:** Um,  
**Jason Bagley:** you.  
**Bjorn:** and so we probably want to start using the same fonts and some of those things, but kind of happy to work on that front as well.  
   
 

### 01:15:49 {#01:15:49}

   
**Bjorn:** not not be limited in yeah I guess brand guidelines as as a way of assisting us rather than saying hey this is what we have Jason stay within these lines kind of  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
**Bjorn:** willing willing to get your advice on kind of how how creative we want to be  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Yeah. Okay.  
**Bjorn:** there  
**Jason Bagley:** So, I'm going to back off on this and say let's not do that because I feel like I need to color outside the lines a little bit and push and you So, what my thing is would be to like let I want to push and provide stuff that's like 8, nine on the scale and then you can pull it back rather than us starting on like a six and I'm trying to push stuff to a seven or an eight instead of the uncomfortableness scale. Right? So, I think it works it'll work better like that. That's why I said I took looked at took one look at your design. I was like, "Okay, I don't know if you like this or not. I don't know where you're at,  
   
 

### 01:16:39

   
**Jason Bagley:** but I'm like, I don't think this is very good. Um, and here's a landing page I think would have done 95% better than what we what you've provided  
**Bjorn:** Get All  
**Jason Bagley:** me and then seeing and then you're like, you know, something like very scared and then I can scale that down,  
**Bjorn:** right.  
**Jason Bagley:** but rather than me trying to just make tweaks to the current one, it's not going to push us far enough." So, I'm going to say, let's not worry about the like the branding and all of that, the the guidelines for now. Let's first get some stuff going. Um, so let's just quickly then talk about Yeah. Um, I think then let's talk about the So for us like you know outreach and all of that is I  
**Bjorn:** Yeah.  
**Jason Bagley:** mean for us it's like you know we do this in our sleep type of thing. So I'm not even worried about us getting that running and all of that stuff.  
**Bjorn:** Ladies and  
**Jason Bagley:** But what I'm what I want to just confirm on your side is like where are you at with the website and are we  
   
 

### 01:17:25 {#01:17:25}

   
**Bjorn:** gentlemen,  
**Jason Bagley:** following the process that you were going down your designer then or we going let us handle this let's get a we're going to use ripplet build out this site get it live um but obviously to a standard that we think is really great um because that's going to I guess shorten this it's going to give us a lot more impact I feel um and your website isn't going to be this massive massive content hub that we need some sort of massive CMS like we have to build a CMS because you have an existing site that has to  
**Bjorn:** Jason, just give me just give me one second.  
**Jason Bagley:** trans  
**Bjorn:** Apologies.  
**Jason Bagley:** um so yeah are you happy to us for to go that route and get the site built obviously when we first start with a um with a site map where we think how the the structure of the site I mean I just went quickly and built that site right but I'm saying we'll create a plan for it and then just start executing on it. Is that how you would see that Dean?  
   
 

### 01:18:32 {#01:18:32}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Happy to go down that  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah, I mean I have no objections to that and it make it makes complete sense to me. Um,  
**Jason Bagley:** road.  
**Dean Nixon:** do you want any objection objections to that? You may be  
**Bjorn:** Yeah, I think um I kind of after seeing the the website I kind of giving you a design.  
**Dean Nixon:** chatting.  
**Bjorn:** So like listen, knock yourself out. We'll we'll pull you back when we need  
**Jason Bagley:** Perfect.  
**Bjorn:** to.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, cool. So, we we're going to go ahead and do that then. Um, so then we we yeah, as I said, I was just saying to De, we just create a basic plan for this in terms of what pages we think we need, how we're going to structure the site,  
**Dean Nixon:** Oh s\*\*\*.  
**Jason Bagley:** why we're doing certain things on the the from a structure perspective, go get it built, get the copy done, images, all of that stuff will help with. I would want some screenshots and stuff of the app and things like that.  
   
 

### 01:19:19 {#01:19:19}

   
**Jason Bagley:** that I'll I'll and I I I want to set up a time where you give us a demo of everything. So, we'll set that up for some time next week. Um and then that'll inform us and we start building. So, that's going to shorten this period to get the site done. Um cool. I'm happy with that. Uh the targeted the outreach campaign. So, just remind me you've got a list again. Can you just tell me about that list again, Dean? I think it was you were talking about it.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah. So the last user conference we went to, we was able to uh get the attendee list. So that conference that we said about where people were bursting out the door of a conference room um for data imports, we have that list which is pretty much gold ready for for the  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay,  
**Dean Nixon:** client base that we need.  
**Bjorn:** And we think that's like what 80% of that list is going to be  
**Jason Bagley:** cool.  
   
 

### 01:20:08

   
**Bjorn:** PMXD.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yes. Correct.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah. Not not all of them because we just got the blanket  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay, cool. Um, nice. I'll I'll talk you through how the plan. So, what I want to do is just come up with the the the outreach plan for this as well. Um, just so that I can understand like explain to you why we would go this direction, how we would do it and what the what it is um for that. So, that's something we'll create. It won't take us long to do that. Come back to you guys and go cool. Take you through that. how we send emails, how we like all best practice and we've done this so many times. It's like load the and it changes so often as well. So, um keep up to date. We don't get that going. Um um come and come back to you on that. And then just in terms of in your heads, is there anything else?  
   
 

### 01:21:02 {#01:21:02}

   
**Jason Bagley:** Like yes, we've got this newsletter which we will talk about regarding the existing clients and the rebrand and all of that which should be cool. Is anything else that that you like in the back of your head like, "Hey, I'd like to have a look at that." Or there's some I thought saw this the other day. I thought maybe that was cool. Like anything else that you're like, but I Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** uh nothing I can think of off the top of my head. I mean the the main points really are kind of existing client base because we can see that we see that as obviously we want to make them aware of the eBox ch branding changes and as we said the majority of our clients are e-connect at the moment who would be a natural fit for eformms at some point as well. So there is kind of a cross-sale opportunity for us to do that. Um but to me it's that out it's the website and the outreach to that MRI list that we've got.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 01:21:51 {#01:21:51}

   
**Dean Nixon:** Um we do have two conferences two MRI based conferences this year as well. One in August one in October. So the August one is in Australia the one in October is the big one again in in America.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay. Awesome. That's good to know. Um, oh, just a question on the current clients, like how often do you talk to them or is it just like they're almost like a set and forget and when they have support they can email you? H how does the relationship work with with your with with  
**Dean Nixon:** So at the moment um it's not very often they kind of get notified when there's a when there's an update at the moment.  
**Jason Bagley:** clients?  
**Dean Nixon:** Uh we want to change that. We want to be communicating more to the existing client base. Uh but it is kind of set and forget at the moment unless we have some kind of update that we need to send  
**Jason Bagley:** Cool. Got you. Um, and then  
**Bjorn:** a couple of big clients that we like do keep more in contact with just because they're quite key.  
   
 

### 01:22:40 {#01:22:40}

   
**Dean Nixon:** them.  
**Jason Bagley:** I  
**Bjorn:** So our top clients, you know, of the of the 40 clients, our top five are kind of half of our revenue. And so we're very aware of the kind of the risk exposure in terms of making sure they're happy.  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** Um they also tend to be the ones that are reaching out for changes more often.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yes.  
**Bjorn:** um a job. The lower we get on the list really,  
**Jason Bagley:** Okay.  
**Bjorn:** the less we speak to them.  
**Jason Bagley:** Right. Okay. Cool. I mean I will I plant the seed because we with you guys is that it would be nice um if we could chat to some of the like end user that actually uses it because often you know interviewing your current customers that are using it gives us the words that they use to describe the thing they're doing is what we want to use in marketing material and emails and things like that um in their words because that's often where you find you know just talking to them finding out what do they really love about the product and what what was the frustration that they used to have and a lot of it's we make assumptions about it and we mostly times are we right but you'll often find sometimes it's just not true like you know you thought that you know you were the the cheapest you were the like the the best priced option that they were going for but actually it wasn't that it was a feature or it's the opposite of  
   
 

### 01:24:10 {#01:24:10}

   
**Jason Bagley:** that like you know price was not a thing or the feature was the whole thing or whatever um so at some point it would be nice to maybe chat to them and get some of like we normally ask a few questions, get that information, get that data and that informs us for a whole bunch of things from the website to landing pages to content to any marketing campaigns that we run. Uh all of that type of type of stuff. Um but it's not an urgent thing that we want to tackle now anyway. Um okay, cool.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah,  
**Jason Bagley:** I'm happy with Yeah.  
**Bjorn:** I've been after this I have a session upstairs with one of our clients who's visiting to to ask them testimonial questions that we're slipping  
**Jason Bagley:** That is awesome. Yeah, that would be cool. Cool. Good to see you. Okay. Um, just in terms of what we're all going to be agreeing to do next, what I'm not going to do is bore us with the detail of this stuff.  
   
 

### 01:25:01 {#01:25:01}

   
**Jason Bagley:** I'm going to put this all in an email, the things I would like from you, what we're going to do next. Um, and uh, what we use this email address, marketing@growthexperts.co. It's a proper inbox that's just for if we need access to any anything. Um, so that's just like a mailbox for like software. We can obviously share it and there's an additional license charges for multiple people and all that stuff. Um, but you can email me directly. We're going to give you access to base camp. I'll explain all of this in an email. I don't want to bore you with all this nitty-gritty admin stuff. Now what I do want to do um from my before I think we can wrap up is Taylor Lauren are there any more questions any thoughts any things you want to still ask because from my side I'm super happy and then I guess from your sounds like Lauren you good Taylor perfect anything else from from your side  
**Dean Nixon:** That's me.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah. No, not at this stage.  
   
 

### 01:26:01

   
**Bjorn:** I'm sure I'm sure lots will come  
**Dean Nixon:** Happy  
**Jason Bagley:** Perfect. Great. So, we'll send a recap email of everything,  
**Bjorn:** up.  
**Jason Bagley:** next steps, meeting cadence, you'll set that up, how to get access to us, all of those things in a succinct short email. Um, and yeah, super looking forward to working with you guys. I think it's quite exciting. Um, so yeah, looking to get get stuck in  
**Bjorn:** Perfect. Yeah, thanks for your time. Uh, looking forward to really am looking forward to working with you guys. I think we uh kind of passed around that that website you set up for us. Um, and everyone was very impressed by it. So, I think we're we're pretty much like that page. We're like that's I mean, we'll change some of the some of the things it says. Other than that, we're like, let's just go live. Let's just push it.  
**Jason Bagley:** Yeah, exactly. I thought so. I thought that would work.  
**Bjorn:** Yeah.  
**Dean Nixon:** Yeah.  
**Jason Bagley:** Nice, nice, nice.  
   
 

### 01:26:52

   
**Bjorn:** So good good move on your  
**Jason Bagley:** Awesome. Cool. Yeah,  
**Bjorn:** part.  
**Jason Bagley:** I will say I will say that um just to tell you a backstory about that. So we had a sales workshop with someone um because our sales process needs to improve, right? And so you were sort of the first company that you I literally had a meeting with him and he was like you need to or we had a call with this sales agency and he helped us understand our sales process and all the holes we have in ours and he said do you do you like pitch to people? I was like what do you mean pitch? I just like we have a call, I chat to them and then I just send them an email like here's our pricing like sign up or not. And he was like you're joking. I was like no that's what we do. He's like no you need to book another call with the person and show them something. Take them through the process. Show them. He was I was like of course I need to do that. Like slap myself in the face. And you were the first one that we did that with. Um and uh I went back to I was like it worked. They signed because it works.
